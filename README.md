Dynamic region-agnostic Nintendo DS ROM patcher

Creates patches which are capable of replacing individual narc files or even narc subfiles without touching anything else in the ROM.

Is currently unable to create patches containing changes to the arm9 or overlays, as I am still working out how to best manage those while keeping the tool functional with every regional version of a game.
